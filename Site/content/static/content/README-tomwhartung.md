# README-tomwhartung.md

At this time, during the initial phase of getting a minimal site up, this directory contains just
the downloaded MDB files.

## Exceptions

Exceptions to the rule are

- This file, `README-tomwhartung.md`
- The file `favicon.ico`
- The empty files `css/tomwhartung.css` and `js/tomwhartung.js`

## Rationale for All-Inclusiveness

The sample `index.html` file, and hence my `base.html` template, use just the `css/*.css` and `js/*.js` files,
so I copied them first.

After some consideration, I decided to copy almost all of the other files in the downloaded zip file into this area as well.
